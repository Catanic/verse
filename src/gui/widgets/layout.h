/**
 * This class is an helper for setting the position of widgets. They are
 * positioned along the cells of some rectangular tables. The layout may either
 * be a single table or a tree of nested tables.
 *
 * The size of a given table column can either be set manually or be chosen
 * from the widest widget of the column. An empty column has a AUTO_DEF width,
 * which means it will be extended so that the layout fits its minimum width.
 *
 * The process is similar for table rows. By default, there is a spacing of 4
 * pixels between rows and between columns, and a margin of 6 pixels around the
 * whole layout.
