1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out ManaVerse from Git or you have downloaded
a source release. To get ManaVerse to compile, you need a compiler (GCC)
and some libraries. The required libraries are:

* SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL_net           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
* SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
* SDL_gfx           http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/software-mainmenu-14/4-ferzkopps-linux-software/19-sdlgfx
* OpenGL            https://www.opengl.org/
* libxml2           http://www.xmlsoft.org/
* zlib 1.2.x        http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
* libcurl           http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

On most distributions the development packages for these libraries must be
installed before building.  For example, on Debian or Ubuntu you can run:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config \
        libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev \
        libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev \
        libcurl4-openssl-dev libpng-dev zlib1g-dev \
        libfreetype6-dev libharfbuzz-dev libgl1-mesa-dev

On Arch Linux and derivatives the equivalent command is:

    sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake sdl2 sdl2_image \
        sdl2_mixer sdl2_net sdl2_ttf sdl2_gfx curl \
        libpng zlib freetype2 harfbuzz mesa

If you've cloned the Git repository, you will also need these tools to compile:

* GNU automake 1.9  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* GNU autoconf      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
* GNU gettext       http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
* CVS               http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ (needed to run autopoint)

On some machines, it's been reported that this package is also needed. However,
you might not need it:

* GNU libtool       http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling And Installing ManaVerse
=====================================

Building with GNU Autotools

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) If you've cloned the Git repository, run "autoreconf -i" to generate
   configure and install any missing auxiliary files.
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"
5) Run "make install" as root

It should have installed ManaVerse on your system now, and you can run it
with "manaverse". By default all files are installed to /usr/local, you can pass
a different prefix to configure as usual.


  NOTE: It is possible to compile ManaVerse without support for OpenGL rendering.
  To do this perform step 3 as follows:

    ./configure --without-opengl

  Rebuild the executable from scratch using "make clean" and then "make".


Building with CMake (unsupported)

1) Create a directory for building and change to that directory.
2) Configure the build with: cmake <path_to_source>
3) Compile with: cmake --build ./
4) Copy files to install directory with: cmake --install ./

  NOTES:
  - To set output directory for install add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to configure command.
  - To build with SDL 2.0 instead of 1.6 add `-DUSE_SDL2=ON` to configure command.
  - To disalbe OpenGL add `-DUSE_OPENGL=OFF` to configure command.
