THE MANAVERSE SOUND DEVELOPMENT

1. INTRODUCTION

In The Mana World we plan to have both background music and sound effects
linked to beings actions.

2. SPECS

The preferred file format is Ogg mastered at 22.050 Hz. Quality factor 3.0
should be enough.
We strongly recomend to not convert the file from a previous format to avoid
loss of quality. 22 Khz is not the best quality we can have, that's why is
really important to have the sound digitally recorded and without noise at
all.

3. DATA REQUIRED

- Login BGM (need to be remastered to improve quality, tempo and remove noise)
- Amzeroth (or whatever it's the name) BGM
- South field BGM
- Level up SFX
- Sword slash SFX
- Bow shot SFX
- Monsters attack SFX
- Monsters death SFX
- Potion SFX (used for every recovery item)

4. SUGGESTIONS

As placeholders we could use Wesnoth SFX/BGM to test the sound engine.
